jparkerweb-GRIDS
================

GRIDS is a user-friendly framework compatible with the numerous devices we encounter daily. This tool-kit features various view-port and size configurations, twelve fluid-width columns, gridline overlays and breakpoint markers to aid in page layout.

There are many grid frameworks available today, but none offer a JavaScript toolset that predictively analyze your columns and provide immediate feedback on where your content will break down (essentially giving you insight as to what each of you breakpoint values should be).  In addition, GRIDS also comes with a cheat sheet to quickly reference all its class names, as well as a grid overlay so you can see how your columns are currently configured and how your next set of content should be defined.
